JS Mantra: When some event happens, I want to make what kind of fetch and then manipulate the DOM in what way?

[ ] When user (enter their username and questions in a form), I want to (post the data to the backend API) and then manipulate the DOM by (showing user their username and questions have been saved)

[ ] When user (click on the "open a question" button), I want to (get questions from the backend API - select random question) and then manipulate the DOM by (appending the questions from backend API to the frontend HTML), so users can see the questions ONE at a time

[ ] When (there is a question already on screen), I want to manipulate the DOM by erasing the question on screen before the next question pops up

Things to fix:
[ ] do not repeat question
[ ] when refresh, everything is gone?
[ ] how to make sure it is clear before new append everytime?



Stretch goals:
[ ] reset game button to delete all users and questions
